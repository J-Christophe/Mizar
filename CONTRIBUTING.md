## 2 - Reports a bug
Here is a short guideline to report a bug step by step

### 2.1 - Identify the bug
The first step in in writing a bug report is to identify exactly what the problem is. 
Saying "something is wrong" is not helpful; saying exactly what is wrong, and how to reproduce it, is. 
If you can tell exactly what is wrong, and reliably reproduce an example of the problem

### 2.2 - Check if you are using the latest version
Bug reports should be based on the the latest version. If you are using a released version or an out-of-date build, 
please update to the latest revision and check to see whether or not the bug still exists.

### 2.3 - Check if the bug is known
Please check whether the bug you get is already documented in the issue tracker. If it is already documented, 
you may click "subscribe" to follow any developments.

### 2.4 - Create a new issue
Sign into Github and go to the issue tracker. Click on "Create a new issue" and write your bug report following
the next sections :

#### 2.5 - Title
The title should describe the problem as best as possible. Remember that the title is read more often than any other part of the bug report.

#### 2.6 - Description

##### 2.6.1 - Steps to reproduce bug
A bug report requires clear instructions, so that others can consistently reproduce it. Many bugs require some 
experimentation to find the exact steps that cause the problem you are trying to report

#### 2.6.2 - Expected behavior
Describe what should happen if the bug was fixed.

#### 2.6.3 - Actual behavior
In contrast to the expected behavior, describe what currently happens when the bug is present.

#### 2.6.4 - Version number
Provides the version number of MIZAR

#### 2.6.4 - Browser
Name the browser you are using and its version number

####Â 2.6.5 - File attachments
If you can supplement your bug report with an image, crash log that helps others reproduce the issue, attach these files.

#### 2.7 - Submit
Click on "Submit" to submit your bug report to the issue tracker.

#### 2.8 - Following up
Once a developer marks a bug as fixed, it is a good idea to ensure that it is completely fixed. To test, download the latest nightly build.
